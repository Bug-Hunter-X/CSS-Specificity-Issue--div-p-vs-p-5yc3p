The following CSS code has an uncommon error related to the specificity of selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `p` selector is more specific than the `div p` selector. Therefore, the `color: red;` declaration will override the `color: blue;` declaration, resulting in all paragraphs having red text, even if they are inside a `div` element.
