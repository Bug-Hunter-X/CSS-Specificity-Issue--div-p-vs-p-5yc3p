The following CSS code demonstrates the solution:

```css
div p {
  color: blue !important;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

By using `!important`, we ensure that the `color: blue;` declaration for paragraphs within a `div` element takes precedence over the `color: red;` declaration for all paragraphs.  While generally it's recommended to avoid `!important`, in cases like this where you need explicit overriding in exceptional situations it is a viable choice.
